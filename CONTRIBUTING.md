1. Please use CRRao and tell us what is not good about it.

2. We have exploited Julia capabilities to make it convenient to build additional functionality within CRRao, and for multiple developers to build new models.

3. We want to build out CRRao into a simple and consistent approach to the statistical modelling workflow. Please help us plan and build this.

4. As a developer, you can begin contributing by adding the features requested in the milestones section of the repository.

5. When you are developing keep in mind that your application is capable of handling the following mandatory features:

  + Formula,
  + DataFrame (optional - you may choose other data types),
  + modelClass,
  + It follows StatsAPI.jl requirement (like it has atleast fit, others capabilities like predict,aic,bic would be great things to have).
  + Provide test cases
  + Check for performance gain against R and Python.
